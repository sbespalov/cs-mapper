# Introdution

There is a common view, that the **_DTO (Data Transfer Object)_**  is an anti-pattern, but **_CSMapper_** targets to dispel this prejudice.

If we imagine a standard **_JavaEE_** application, then, as a rule, it has a "Layered architecture" with an API on top and JPA domain model at the bottom. Also we can say that API (Presentation) layer model depends on **_JPA Entity Model_**, and is a kind of its projection.
