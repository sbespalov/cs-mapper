# Introdution

There is a common view, that the **_DTO (Data Transfer Object)_**  is an anti-pattern, but **_CSMapper_** targets to dispel this prejudice.

If we imagine a standard **_JavaEE_** application, then, as a rule, it has a "Layered architecture" with an API on top, which is **_Presensation Layer_**, and JPA domain model at the bottom, which is **_Persistence Layer_**. Also we can say that API parameters depends on **_JPA Entity Model_** at most, and is a kind of its projection. So, based on the above, we can say that we needed something like a DTO here.
